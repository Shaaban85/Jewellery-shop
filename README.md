# Jewellery shop - website

## UX

I created website called 'JEWELLERY' that allows user to purchase jewelry products.
The purpose of the website is to successfully sell Jewelry online and drive more sales for the business.
This website lets users/customers shop from anywhere at any time. Jewellery is a great fit for ecommerce as products 
are lightweight and easy to ship, come in many variations, and can be customized.

As a user you can:

* register and login to the page
* reset and change password
* search products by using search bar in the navigation bar
* search products by using categories navigation bar 
* view particular product by clicking on the 'view' link
* add to cart product by choosing quantity first
* amend product by choosing quantity first
* view products added to the cart
* purchase product by going to the checkout page, complete the form and submit the payment
* when register and logged in, view other users post by clicking on the blog in navbar
* write your own post by clicking on 'write your review here' link
* contact the shop by sending email through the contact form by clicking on the 'contact' link on the bottom of any page
* view information about the shop by clicking on any link on the bottom of any page
